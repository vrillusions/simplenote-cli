## Bug reports

* Include as much information as possible
* Include version of this project, operating system version, python version, version of anything else related to this

## Contributing code

* Please follow code conventions. For the most part it's [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
* Unix line endings
* Remove trailing white space and blank lines, aside from a single blank line at bottom

## Licensing

While licensing seems boring or downright scary, it's important that you understand this and how contributed code is licensed.

* Any code contributions are under the same license as this project, which is currently the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
* You also assert that any code you contribute was created solely by you or obtained from sources that permit you to use it. ie Don't copy stuff from work which typically belongs to the company unless they do open source projects.
* You permit the contributed code to be relicensed if the project is relicensed. Meaning if the project is relicensed under a license you don't agree with, you can't retroactively remove your code from the project. This is mostly due to the technical difficulty of removing a section of code especially if mutliple people have modified parts of it.
